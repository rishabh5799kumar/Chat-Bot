# Chatbot Project

This project is a simple chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. The chatbot can understand user input based on predefined intents and provide appropriate responses. The model is trained on a custom dataset of intents and patterns using a neural network implemented in TensorFlow.

## Features
- Tokenizes and lemmatizes user input to preprocess the text for analysis.
- Uses a neural network for text classification to identify user intents.
- Flexible architecture for adding new intents and patterns.
- Saves trained models and vocabulary using pickle for future use.

## Requirements
- Python
- TensorFlow
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
